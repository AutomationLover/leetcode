```python

def inorderTravelsal(root):
    WHITE, GRAY = 0, 1
    res = []
    stack = [(WHITE, root)]
    while stack:
        color, node = stack.pop()
        if node is None:
            continue
        if color == WHITE:
            stack.append((WHITE, node.right))
            stack.append((GRAY, node))
            stack.append((WHITE, node.left))
        else:
            res.append(node.val)
    return res
```

In the provided Python code, a non-recursive approach to in-order traversal of a binary tree is implemented using a stack. The key to understanding this approach lies in the use of the `WHITE` and `GRAY` variables, which are set to 0 and 1, respectively. These variables are used to tag nodes with colors (WHITE or GRAY) in the stack to control the traversal flow. Here's a breakdown of why defining `WHITE` and `GRAY` helps in this context:

### 1. Simulating Recursive Behavior

In a recursive in-order traversal, the process goes as follows for each node: visit the left child, visit the node itself, and then visit the right child. The challenge in converting this to an iterative approach (using a stack) is to maintain the correct order of operations without using the call stack provided by recursion.

By using `WHITE` and `GRAY` tags, we can simulate the recursive calls and the state of each node's processing. A `WHITE` tag means that the node and its children have not been processed yet, while a `GRAY` tag indicates that the node's left child has been processed, and now the node itself can be processed (i.e., added to the result list) before moving on to its right child.

### 2. Managing Node States

The color-coding (using `WHITE` and `GRAY`) effectively manages the state of each node in the traversal process:
- **WHITE** signifies that the node is yet to be explored. This means we need to process its left child, then the node itself, and finally its right child. By pushing nodes onto the stack with the `WHITE` tag, we're queuing them for further exploration.
- **GRAY** indicates that the node's left child has been dealt with, and now the node itself can be processed (i.e., its value can be added to the result list), followed by its right child.

This state management allows us to mimic the call stack that would naturally occur in a recursive approach, using an iterative method instead.

### 3. Ensuring Correct Processing Order

When a `WHITE` node is encountered, it's re-added to the stack with a `GRAY` tag, but only after its right child (also tagged as `WHITE`) and then its left child (tagged as `WHITE`) are added to the stack. This ensures that the stack will next process the left child, then the node itself (now as `GRAY`), and finally the right child, replicating the in-order traversal sequence without the need for recursion.

### 4. Efficiency and Clarity

By distinguishing between nodes that need further processing (`WHITE`) and those ready to be output (`GRAY`), the code efficiently manages the traversal logic within a single loop. This not only improves clarity by avoiding complex conditionals and state checks but also leverages the stack data structure effectively to maintain the traversal state.

### Conclusion

Defining `WHITE` and `GRAY` and using them to tag nodes on the stack is a clever way to convert the recursive in-order traversal algorithm into an iterative one. This approach maintains the traversal order without recursion, using a stack to simulate the call stack. It provides a clear and efficient method to perform an in-order traversal on a binary tree, showcasing a significant application of state management and control flow in iterative algorithms.
